Snapp X company handbook.

The Snapp X handbook is the central repository of how we run the company.  It
is a living document that is updated as we learn and grow.  We welcome your
feedback and contributions.

There are many things missing from this handbook; contributions are welcome.
We found and copied a lot of this handbook from Shorebird because we think a 
lot of what they wrote in theirs is worth reading, so we will use it as a starting
point for ours. Please feel free to do the same with ours.
