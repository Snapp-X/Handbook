## Values

* Remote first, the world is too big to all stay in one place, there are some heavy
  downsides with that, but the benefits seem so high that I would like to at least try.
* Working smart over working hard.
* We prioritize creating a workplace where safety and support are paramount. By
  nurturing a culture of trust and collaboration, we aim to empower individuals to bring their authentic selves to work, knowing that their well-being is a top priority.
* We foster teamwork beyond the boundaries of our own organisation and the building of
  meaningful connections, recognizing the strength that collaborative efforts and networking bring to achieving shared goals.
* We celebrate the spirit of curiosity and encourage a constant quest for discovery,
  allowing us to continuously learn, adapt, and innovate.
* We are willing to pay the price of productivity in order to achieve creativity.


## Communication

Right now we all just use Slack.  We have email, but mostly we use that for
communicating to the outside world or things which need a more permanent record.
Everything else happens on Slack.
